## My Style

- My Myers-Briggs type is [Assertive Protagonist - ENFJ-A](https://www.16personalities.com/enfj-personality). 
- I'm very direct. I'll tell you when things are great, but I'll also let you know if there's something I'm not happy about.
- I have high standards in general, and that includes work. That's why, as a manager, I will always try to find things we can improve on. No matter if we've been outstanding at work, there are always things to be better at. 
- I try to be in the best mood at all times. You'll hear me cracking a joke more often than not. A happy environment is a great environment to work in.
- I'm proud of my ethical and moral values, which are nonnegotiable. I can spend a long time talking about them, and I'm more than happy to discuss in detail and give examples, but they can be summarised in:
  - Honesty.
  - Humility.
  - Empathy.
  - Doing the right thing, even if it brings negative personal consequences.
- I focus much more on the process than on the end result. If we do the wrong thing and it ends up working well, I'm not happy, because doing the wrong thing will lead to bad results more often than not.
- I love teaching and mentoring. I'm more than happy to help you with new concepts or investigate something together. This doesn't have to be work-related.

## What I value 

- Honesty and transparency. Set the right expectations. Don't tell me what I want to hear, tell me what I should hear.
- Courage. To own screw-ups, to respectfully disagree, to not shy away from challenges, to ask for help.
- Teamwork. No individual is more important than the team.
- Open-mindedness. Changing your opinion is normally a strength, not a weakness. 
- Respect. Be nice to everyone (as long as they are nice to you!). Don't care about their role, seniority, or anything else. 
- Good memes and gifs on Slack!


## What I don't have patience for

- Bullshit.
- Useless politics.
- Selfishness, individualism.
- Meetings that should have been a Slack message instead.
- People talking about things they have no idea about.
- People making concepts harder than what they are, just to sound smarter.
- Talking to you directly and you playing with your phone or using Slack ðŸ˜¬

## How to best communicate with me

In terms of the communication channel or medium, from best to worst:

- Face-to-face.
- Google Meet.
- Slack.
- Email.

For simple things, though, don't book unnecessary meetings, please.

In terms of _how_ to communicate with me, please read the sections above.

## How to help me

- Give me constructive feedback. Tell me what I can do to be better. Positive feedback is great and looks fantastic in performance reviews, but praises won't make me grow and improve. Anonymous feedback is always welcome as well.
- All of us are quite busy. If I ask you, individually or as a group, to do or help me with something, please, try to get it done and keep me updated regularly rather than me having to constantly chase you for updates.
